title: About me
---

My name is Joe Polny and I am a professional software engineer that currently works for the Algorand Foundation on the developer relations team. I have always been passionate about tech, but blockchain technology has caught my interest in a way that nothing has before. A lot of the content on this blog will be focused on blockchain-related topics, but I'll hopefully be writing about some of my other interests including various areas of technology and science.
